When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository allows you to interact with github and makes collaborative work possible, it also allows other people to view, and/or improve your code. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having manual control over pulling changes allows the user to pull whenever a logical change has been made. An automatic pull would simply pull everytime there is a change, so commits would begin to clutter.
