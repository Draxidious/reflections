When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository allows you to interact with github and makes collaborative work possible, it also allows other people to view, and/or improve your code. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Having manual control over pulling changes allows the user to pull whenever a logical change has been made. An automatic pull would simply pull everytime there is a change, so commits would begin to clutter. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used to clone a repository from github onto your github. This allows you to create your own version of someone elses repository quickly, collaboratively and easily, while still giving credit to the original owner. Cloning is like forking but is not exculsive to github. Cloning does not aid very well in collaborative work when it comes to collaboratively editing someones existing repository. Branching creates a new label for different commits/different versions of code. While apart of repositories, it does change them, only add to them.
